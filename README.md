# COVID-19-hotspot-detectoin
This project shows the hotspots of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran's map. Written in python using Jupyter Notebook
Due to the large file size I compressed the .ipynb to .zip file
Please run the .ipynb on jupyter server with your browser because there is a library that needs to represent map using browser
